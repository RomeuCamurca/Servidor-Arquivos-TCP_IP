Faststart for Cloud-in-a-box!

To install your Eucalyptus cloud on a CentOS/RHEL 7 system, run the Faststart script from the top level eucalyptus-cookbook directory, such as:

    faststart/cloud-in-a-box.sh

A few notes:
* Must run as root;
* Must have curl installed;
* Must have internet access;
* Must have a fixed IP address for the host (i.e. no DHCP);
* Must have some IP addresses set aside on the local network;
* Runs on CentOS or RHEL 7 only.
