Welcome to Eucalyptus!  Here's a more detailed look at some of the commands necessary to get
you started.  For a more in-depth explanation of Eucalyptus commands, please consult the 
Eucalyptus User Guide:

SOURCING CREDENTIALS

Without credentials, Eucalyptus doesn't know who you are.  You must source your credentials
to run any Eucalyptus commands.

By default, Faststart only sets up one user: the admin user.  The credentials created in 
~/eucarc belong to the admin user.  To source these credentials, run the following command:

  source ~/eucarc

To learn more about how access works in Eucalyptus, consult the Manage Access section of the
Administration Guide:

DESCRIBING IMAGES

A cloud is only as useful as the images that are available on that cloud.  By default, 
Faststart sets you up with CirrOS, a small Linux image meant for cloud testing. 

To see the images available on your cloud, run the following command:

  euca-describe-images

The output will look something like this:

[root@ciab ~]# euca-describe-images 
IMAGE	emi-f0594352	default/default.img.manifest.xml	141239169078	available	public	x86_64	machine				instance-store	hvm

The most important part of this output is the Eucalyptus Machine Image identifier, or EMI ID. 
In this case, the EMI ID is emi-f0594352.  Each EMI ID is unique to that specific cloud, and
is generated when an image is uploaded.

For more information about the euca-describe-images command output, consult the euca2ools guide:

https://docs.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus/4.4.2/index.html#euca2ools-guide/euca-describe-images.html

Initially, only the one image is installed, and it isn't very useful.  Your first task will be
to install a more useful Linux image that can do real work.

INSTALLING IMAGES

Many Linux distributions now have preconfigured cloud images; the easiest way to get
started is to download and install one of these preconfigured cloud images.  We're going to
start with Fedora 27. 

  # Download the image
  curl -L https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/27/CloudImages/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-27-1.6.x86_64.raw.xz > fedora.raw.xz

  # Unzip the image.
  xz -d fedora.raw.xz 

  # Install the image.
  euca-install-image -n Fedora27 -b fedora -i fedora.raw -r x86_64 --virtualization-type hvm

  # Set the image to be available to all users.
  euca-modify-image-attribute -l -a all $(euca-describe-images | grep fedora | grep emi | cut -f 2)

  # Finally, run an instance based on the new image.
  euca-run-instances -k my-first-keypair $(euca-describe-images | grep fedora | grep emi | cut -f 2)

  # Run euca-describe-instances to get information about your instances.
  euca-describe-instances

  # Once your instance is listed as "running", ssh to it. Don't forget to specify the right keypair!
  ssh -i ~/my-first-keypair 192.168.1.101 (or whatever the IP of your instance is)
